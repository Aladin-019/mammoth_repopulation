# Original data from CDS was of hourly snowfall rate in GRIB format.
# Millimeters (mm).
# This script processes a GRIB file to extract daily mean and variance of snowfall
# from specified locations and saves the results to CSV files.
# Daily mean and variance used to stochastically simulate daily large scale snowfall variations
# in the mammoth repopulation simulator.

# Locations: Krasnoyarsk (south taiga), Salekhard (north taiga), 
#            Saskylakh (south tundra), and Cape Chelyuskin (north tundra).

# Locations span a gradient of the siberian biomes from taiga (warmer) to tundra (cooler). 
# This is to get a better mapping of the UV variations across siberia.
