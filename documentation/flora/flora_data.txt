Outline of main flora types of Siberia split into the two main biomes, Taiga and Tundra. 
Including each of their biomass proportions relative to the whole, and their climate survival 
conditions. Tree canopy cover ratio included.


Taiga

Biomass proportions (percentage of total live‐standing biomass)
(Values based on g dry mass per m^2 estimates)

Plant group	    Biomass (g/m^2)	     % of total biomass
Trees (conifers: spruce, pine, fir, larch) 2636 	54.1 %
Shrubs (dwarf birch, willow, ericaceous) 833 	17.1 %
Lichens (ground dwelling Cladonia, Peltigera, etc.) 939 	19.3 %
Mosses (e.g., Sphagnum, Pleurozium) 362 	 7.4 %
Herbaceous vascular (forbs, grasses, sedges) ≈ 80 	 1.6 %


Ground cover proportions (percentage of ground surface beneath the canopy)
Plant group	Ground cover (%)
Shrubs (dwarf birch, willow, Ericaceae) 15 % 
Herbaceous vascular (forbs, grasses, sedges) 33 % 
Mosses (bryophytes) 20 % 
Lichens (ground dwelling; Cladonia, Peltigera) 32 %


Trees are about 34% canopy cover
80% coniferous, 20% deciduous


Plant Group	Temperature extremes, lethal days	Drought, lethal days
Coniferous Trees
(pine, spruce, larch, fir)	
• Cold: 1 day below –60 °C kills buds/needles of seedlings
• Heat: ~5 days > 35 °C kills young trees 	• Seedlings: ~70 days without rain (< 0.11 cm/day)
• Mature: > 100 days severe drought before hydraulic failure
Dwarf Shrubs
(dwarf birch, willow, ericaceous)	
• Cold: survive weeks at –60 °C in dormancy 
• Heat: ~7 days > 30 °C causes dieback (species dependent)	
• Established shrubs: begin to fail after ~ 30 days without rain; widespread mortality by ~ 60 days
Herbaceous Vascular Plants
(forbs, grasses, sedges)	
• Frost: single night < 0 °C kills above ground tissues of frost sensitive species 
• Heat: ~7 days > 30 °C lethal to many forbs	
• Drought: wilting point reached in 26 ± 9 days; death follows within days
Mosses
(Sphagnum, Pleurozium)	
• Cold: survive ≥ 30 days at –196 °C & ≥ 5 years at –80 °C 
• Heat: short bursts > 40 °C for days tolerated
• Survive > 100 days of dryness; only months long drought causes major decline
Lichens
(Cladonia, Peltigera, etc.)	
• Cold/Heat: tolerate –50 °C to + 40 °C extremes for days; survive 15 days in space vacuum 	
• Remain viable 6 – 12 months without hydration

Tundra 

Plant Group	Biomass (g/m^2)	% of Total Biomass
Shrubs (e.g., dwarf birch, willow)	140–340	~35–45%	Dominant in Low Arctic; biomass increases with warmer temperatures.
Mosses (e.g., Sphagnum, Pleurozium)	0–820	~30–40%	Significant ground cover; varies by location.
Lichens (e.g., Cladonia, Peltigera)	50–300	~10–20%	Important in High Arctic regions.
Herbaceous Vascular Plants (forbs, grasses, sedges)	7–112	~5–10%	Includes sedges and grasses; biomass varies with moisture availability.

Plant group	Ground cover (%) 
Shrubs (e.g., dwarf birch, willow)	15–30%	Coverage increases in warmer, southern tundra regions.
Mosses (bryophytes)	20–40%	Common across various tundra types; significant in moist areas.
Lichens (e.g., Cladonia, Peltigera)	10–30%	Predominant in drier, colder regions; crucial for ecosystem function.
Herbaceous Vascular Plants (forbs, grasses, sedges)	10–25%	Distribution varies with soil moisture and temperature.

Plant Group   Temperature Extremes	 Drought Tolerance
Shrubs (e.g., dwarf birch, willow)	 Survive down to –60 °C	  Begin to fail after ~30 days without rain
Mosses (e.g., Sphagnum, Pleurozium)	Survive ≥ 30 days at –196 °C	Survive > 100 days of dryness
Lichens (e.g., Cladonia, Peltigera)	Tolerate –50 °C to +40 °C	Remain viable 6–12 months without hydration
Herbaceous Vascular Plants (forbs, grasses, sedges)	Frost-sensitive species can be killed by a single night < 0 °C	Wilting point reached in 26 ± 9 days; death follows within days
